# Introduction

Hello, everyone! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Matthew Brown, and I hail from the beautiful state of Michigan, USA.

## About Me

I'm thrilled to be a part of CIT262 and I'm eager to learn alongside all of you. While I have some experience in coding and GitHub, I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and dive deeper into the world of version control and collaborative coding.

## Hobbies and Interests

One of my biggest passions outside the digital realm is tinkering with my homelab. There's something incredibly satisfying about setting up servers, experimenting with new software, and creating a personalized computing environment right at home. It's both my hobby and my creative outlet.

Let's make this class a memorable experience! ðŸš€
